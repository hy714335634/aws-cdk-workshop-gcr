This module allows bundling Docker images as assets.

Images are built from a local Docker context directory (with a `Dockerfile`),
uploaded to ECR by the CDK toolkit and/or your app's CI-CD pipeline, and can be
naturally referenced in your CDK app.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk.aws_ecr_assets import DockerImageAsset

asset = DockerImageAsset(self, "MyBuildImage",
    directory=path.join(__dirname, "my-image")
)
```

The directory `my-image` must include a `Dockerfile`.

This will instruct the toolkit to build a Docker image from `my-image`, push it
to an AWS ECR repository and wire the name of the repository as CloudFormation
parameters to your stack.

Use `asset.imageUri` to reference the image (it includes both the ECR image URL
and tag.

You can optionally pass build args to the `docker build` command by specifying
the `buildArgs` property:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
asset = DockerImageAsset(self, "MyBuildImage",
    directory=path.join(__dirname, "my-image"),
    build_args={
        "HTTP_PROXY": "http://10.20.30.2:1234"
    }
)
```

You can optionally pass a target to the `docker build` command by specifying
the `target` property:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
asset = DockerImageAsset(self, "MyBuildImage",
    directory=path.join(__dirname, "my-image"),
    target="a-target"
)
```

### Pull Permissions

Depending on the consumer of your image asset, you will need to make sure
the principal has permissions to pull the image.

In most cases, you should use the `asset.repository.grantPull(principal)`
method. This will modify the IAM policy of the principal to allow it to
pull images from this repository.

If the pulling principal is not in the same account or is an AWS service that
doesn't assume a role in your account (e.g. AWS CodeBuild), pull permissions
must be granted on the **resource policy** (and not on the principal's policy).
To do that, you can use `asset.repository.addToResourcePolicy(statement)` to
grant the desired principal the following permissions: "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
"ecr:BatchGetImage" and "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability".
