The `@aws-cdk/aws-stepfunctions` package contains constructs for building
serverless workflows using objects. Use this in conjunction with the
`@aws-cdk/aws-stepfunctions-tasks` package, which contains classes used
to call other AWS services.

Defining a workflow looks like this (for the [Step Functions Job Poller
example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/job-status-poller-sample.html)):

### TypeScript example

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_stepfunctions as sfn
import aws_cdk.aws_stepfunctions_tasks as tasks
import aws_cdk.aws_lambda as lambda

submit_lambda = lambda.Function(self, "SubmitLambda", ...)
get_status_lambda = lambda.Function(self, "CheckLambda", ...)

submit_job = tasks.LambdaInvoke(self, "Submit Job",
    lambda_function=submit_lambda,
    # Lambda's result is in the attribute `Payload`
    output_path="$.Payload"
)

wait_x = sfn.Wait(self, "Wait X Seconds",
    time=sfn.WaitTime.seconds_path("$.waitSeconds")
)

get_status = tasks.LambdaInvoke(self, "Get Job Status",
    lambda_function=get_status_lambda,
    # Pass just the field named "guid" into the Lambda, put the
    # Lambda's result in a field called "status" in the response
    input_path="$.guid",
    output_path="$.Payload"
)

job_failed = sfn.Fail(self, "Job Failed",
    cause="AWS Batch Job Failed",
    error="DescribeJob returned FAILED"
)

final_status = tasks.LambdaInvoke(self, "Get Final Job Status",
    lambda_function=get_status_lambda,
    # Use "guid" field as input
    input_path="$.guid",
    output_path="$.Payload"
)

definition = submit_job.next(wait_x).next(get_status).next(sfn.Choice(self, "Job Complete?").when(sfn.Condition.string_equals("$.status", "FAILED"), job_failed).when(sfn.Condition.string_equals("$.status", "SUCCEEDED"), final_status).otherwise(wait_x))

sfn.StateMachine(self, "StateMachine",
    definition=definition,
    timeout=Duration.minutes(5)
)
```

You can find more sample snippets and learn more about the service integrations
in the `@aws-cdk/aws-stepfunctions-tasks` package.

## State Machine

A `stepfunctions.StateMachine` is a resource that takes a state machine
definition. The definition is specified by its start state, and encompasses
all states reachable from the start state:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
start_state = stepfunctions.Pass(self, "StartState")

stepfunctions.StateMachine(self, "StateMachine",
    definition=start_state
)
```

State machines execute using an IAM Role, which will automatically have all
permissions added that are required to make all state machine tasks execute
properly (for example, permissions to invoke any Lambda functions you add to
your workflow). A role will be created by default, but you can supply an
existing one as well.

## Amazon States Language

This library comes with a set of classes that model the [Amazon States
Language](https://states-language.net/spec.html). The following State classes
are supported:

* [`Task`](#task)
* [`Pass`](#pass)
* [`Wait`](#wait)
* [`Choice`](#choice)
* [`Parallel`](#parallel)
* [`Succeed`](#succeed)
* [`Fail`](#fail)
* [`Map`](#map)
* [`Custom State`](#custom-state)

An arbitrary JSON object (specified at execution start) is passed from state to
state and transformed during the execution of the workflow. For more
information, see the States Language spec.

### Task

A `Task` represents some work that needs to be done. The exact work to be
done is determine by a class that implements `IStepFunctionsTask`, a collection
of which can be found in the `@aws-cdk/aws-stepfunctions-tasks` module.

The tasks in the `@aws-cdk/aws-stepfunctions-tasks` module support the
[service integration pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-resource.html) that integrates Step Functions with services
directly in the Amazon States language.

### Pass

A `Pass` state passes its input to its output, without performing work.
Pass states are useful when constructing and debugging state machines.

The following example injects some fixed data into the state machine through
the `result` field. The `result` field will be added to the input and the result
will be passed as the state's output.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# Makes the current JSON state { ..., "subObject": { "hello": "world" } }
pass = stepfunctions.Pass(self, "Add Hello World",
    result={"hello": "world"},
    result_path="$.subObject"
)

# Set the next state
pass.next(next_state)
```

The `Pass` state also supports passing key-value pairs as input. Values can
be static, or selected from the input with a path.

The following example filters the `greeting` field from the state input
and also injects a field called `otherData`.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
pass = stepfunctions.Pass(self, "Filter input and inject data",
    parameters={# input to the pass state
        "input": stepfunctions.DataAt("$.input.greeting"),
        "other_data": "some-extra-stuff"}
)
```

The object specified in `parameters` will be the input of the `Pass` state.
Since neither `Result` nor `ResultPath` are supplied, the `Pass` state copies
its input through to its output.

Learn more about the [Pass state](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/amazon-states-language-pass-state.html)

### Wait

A `Wait` state waits for a given number of seconds, or until the current time
hits a particular time. The time to wait may be taken from the execution's JSON
state.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# Wait until it's the time mentioned in the the state object's "triggerTime"
# field.
wait = stepfunctions.Wait(self, "Wait For Trigger Time",
    time=stepfunctions.WaitTime.timestamp_path("$.triggerTime")
)

# Set the next state
wait.next(start_the_work)
```

### Choice

A `Choice` state can take a different path through the workflow based on the
values in the execution's JSON state:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
choice = stepfunctions.Choice(self, "Did it work?")

# Add conditions with .when()
choice.when(stepfunctions.Condition.string_equal("$.status", "SUCCESS"), success_state)
choice.when(stepfunctions.Condition.number_greater_than("$.attempts", 5), failure_state)

# Use .otherwise() to indicate what should be done if none of the conditions match
choice.otherwise(try_again_state)
```

If you want to temporarily branch your workflow based on a condition, but have
all branches come together and continuing as one (similar to how an `if ... then ... else` works in a programming language), use the `.afterwards()` method:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
choice = stepfunctions.Choice(self, "What color is it?")
choice.when(stepfunctions.Condition.string_equal("$.color", "BLUE"), handle_blue_item)
choice.when(stepfunctions.Condition.string_equal("$.color", "RED"), handle_red_item)
choice.otherwise(handle_other_item_color)

# Use .afterwards() to join all possible paths back together and continue
choice.afterwards().next(ship_the_item)
```

If your `Choice` doesn't have an `otherwise()` and none of the conditions match
the JSON state, a `NoChoiceMatched` error will be thrown. Wrap the state machine
in a `Parallel` state if you want to catch and recover from this.

### Parallel

A `Parallel` state executes one or more subworkflows in parallel. It can also
be used to catch and recover from errors in subworkflows.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
parallel = stepfunctions.Parallel(self, "Do the work in parallel")

# Add branches to be executed in parallel
parallel.branch(ship_item)
parallel.branch(send_invoice)
parallel.branch(restock)

# Retry the whole workflow if something goes wrong
parallel.add_retry(max_attempts=1)

# How to recover from errors
parallel.add_catch(send_failure_notification)

# What to do in case everything succeeded
parallel.next(close_order)
```

### Succeed

Reaching a `Succeed` state terminates the state machine execution with a
succesful status.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
success = stepfunctions.Succeed(self, "We did it!")
```

### Fail

Reaching a `Fail` state terminates the state machine execution with a
failure status. The fail state should report the reason for the failure.
Failures can be caught by encompassing `Parallel` states.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
success = stepfunctions.Fail(self, "Fail",
    error="WorkflowFailure",
    cause="Something went wrong"
)
```

### Map

A `Map` state can be used to run a set of steps for each element of an input array.
A `Map` state will execute the same steps for multiple entries of an array in the state input.

While the `Parallel` state executes multiple branches of steps using the same input, a `Map` state will
execute the same steps for multiple entries of an array in the state input.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
map = stepfunctions.Map(self, "Map State",
    max_concurrency=1,
    items_path=stepfunctions.Data.string_at("$.inputForMap")
)
map.iterator(stepfunctions.Pass(self, "Pass State"))
```

### Custom State

It's possible that the high-level constructs for the states or `stepfunctions-tasks` do not have
the states or service integrations you are looking for. The primary reasons for this lack of
functionality are:

* A [service integration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-service-integrations.html) is available through Amazon States Langauge, but not available as construct
  classes in the CDK.
* The state or state properties are available through Step Functions, but are not configurable
  through constructs

If a feature is not available, a `CustomState` can be used to supply any Amazon States Language
JSON-based object as the state definition.

[Code Snippets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/tutorial-code-snippet.html#tutorial-code-snippet-1) are available and can be plugged in as the state definition.

Custom states can be chained together with any of the other states to create your state machine
definition. You will also need to provide any permissions that are required to the `role` that
the State Machine uses.

The following example uses the `DynamoDB` service integration to insert data into a DynamoDB table.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_dynamodb as ddb
import aws_cdk.core as cdk
import aws_cdk.aws_stepfunctions as sfn

# create a table
table = ddb.Table(self, "montable",
    partition_key=Attribute(
        name="id",
        type=ddb.AttributeType.STRING
    )
)

final_status = sfn.Pass(stack, "final step")

# States language JSON to put an item into DynamoDB
# snippet generated from https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/tutorial-code-snippet.html#tutorial-code-snippet-1
state_json = {
    "Type": "Task",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:states:::dynamodb:putItem",
    "Parameters": {
        "TableName": table.table_name,
        "Item": {
            "id": {
                "S": "MyEntry"
            }
        }
    },
    "ResultPath": null
}

# custom state which represents a task to insert data into DynamoDB
custom = sfn.CustomState(self, "my custom task",
    state_json=state_json
)

chain = sfn.Chain.start(custom).next(final_status)

sm = sfn.StateMachine(self, "StateMachine",
    definition=chain,
    timeout=cdk.Duration.seconds(30)
)

# don't forget permissions. You need to assign them
table.grant_write_data(sm.role)
```

## Task Chaining

To make defining work flows as convenient (and readable in a top-to-bottom way)
as writing regular programs, it is possible to chain most methods invocations.
In particular, the `.next()` method can be repeated. The result of a series of
`.next()` calls is called a **Chain**, and can be used when defining the jump
targets of `Choice.on` or `Parallel.branch`:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
definition = step1.next(step2).next(choice.when(condition1, step3.next(step4).next(step5)).otherwise(step6).afterwards()).next(parallel.branch(step7.next(step8)).branch(step9.next(step10))).next(finish)

stepfunctions.StateMachine(self, "StateMachine",
    definition=definition
)
```

If you don't like the visual look of starting a chain directly off the first
step, you can use `Chain.start`:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
definition = stepfunctions.Chain.start(step1).next(step2).next(step3)
```

## State Machine Fragments

It is possible to define reusable (or abstracted) mini-state machines by
defining a construct that implements `IChainable`, which requires you to define
two fields:

* `startState: State`, representing the entry point into this state machine.
* `endStates: INextable[]`, representing the (one or more) states that outgoing
  transitions will be added to if you chain onto the fragment.

Since states will be named after their construct IDs, you may need to prefix the
IDs of states if you plan to instantiate the same state machine fragment
multiples times (otherwise all states in every instantiation would have the same
name).

The class `StateMachineFragment` contains some helper functions (like
`prefixStates()`) to make it easier for you to do this. If you define your state
machine as a subclass of this, it will be convenient to use:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
class MyJob(stepfunctions.StateMachineFragment):

    def __init__(self, parent, id, *, jobFlavor):
        super().__init__(parent, id)

        first = stepfunctions.Task(self, "First", ...)
        # ...
        last = stepfunctions.Task(self, "Last", ...)

        self.start_state = first
        self.end_states = [last]

# Do 3 different variants of MyJob in parallel
stepfunctions.Parallel(self, "All jobs").branch(MyJob(self, "Quick", job_flavor="quick").prefix_states()).branch(MyJob(self, "Medium", job_flavor="medium").prefix_states()).branch(MyJob(self, "Slow", job_flavor="slow").prefix_states())
```

A few utility functions are available to parse state machine fragments.

* `State.findReachableStates`: Retrieve the list of states reachable from a given state.
* `State.findReachableEndStates`: Retrieve the list of end or terminal states reachable from a given state.

## Activity

**Activities** represent work that is done on some non-Lambda worker pool. The
Step Functions workflow will submit work to this Activity, and a worker pool
that you run yourself, probably on EC2, will pull jobs from the Activity and
submit the results of individual jobs back.

You need the ARN to do so, so if you use Activities be sure to pass the Activity
ARN into your worker pool:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
activity = stepfunctions.Activity(self, "Activity")

# Read this CloudFormation Output from your application and use it to poll for work on
# the activity.
cdk.CfnOutput(self, "ActivityArn", value=activity.activity_arn)
```

## Metrics

`Task` object expose various metrics on the execution of that particular task. For example,
to create an alarm on a particular task failing:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
cloudwatch.Alarm(self, "TaskAlarm",
    metric=task.metric_failed(),
    threshold=1,
    evaluation_periods=1
)
```

There are also metrics on the complete state machine:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
cloudwatch.Alarm(self, "StateMachineAlarm",
    metric=state_machine.metric_failed(),
    threshold=1,
    evaluation_periods=1
)
```

And there are metrics on the capacity of all state machines in your account:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
cloudwatch.Alarm(self, "ThrottledAlarm",
    metric=StateTransitionMetrics.metric_throttled_events(),
    threshold=10,
    evaluation_periods=2
)
```

## Logging

Enable logging to CloudWatch by passing a logging configuration with a
destination LogGroup:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
log_group = logs.LogGroup(stack, "MyLogGroup")

stepfunctions.StateMachine(stack, "MyStateMachine",
    definition=stepfunctions.Chain.start(stepfunctions.Pass(stack, "Pass")),
    logs={
        "destinations": log_group,
        "level": stepfunctions.LogLevel.ALL
    }
)
```

## Future work

Contributions welcome:

* [ ] A single `LambdaTask` class that is both a `Lambda` and a `Task` in one
  might make for a nice API.
* [ ] Expression parser for Conditions.
* [ ] Simulate state machines in unit tests.
